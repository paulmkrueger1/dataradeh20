# dataradeh20
Dataraaaaaade...H20!  repo with tools, notebooks, knowledge share for database porting, storage, access, etc.
Separate from lsk, which is focused on statistical modeling.

## Files:
+ type_schema.py
  + doc describing the classes of objects we'll need that well describe screenshop data organization
+ Amplitude ETL.ipynb
  + notebook with recipe for accessing snowflake database.  will eventually be depricated when we move to bigtable and bigquery

## TODO:
+ add versions to requirements.txt

## NOTES:
+ this is all brand new.  expect to change rapidly.  check files often, stay in touch, don't take this readme on faith
+ take special care to check type_schema, as it's core to the system we're building
